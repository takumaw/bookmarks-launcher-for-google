Bookmarks Launcher for Google
=============================

(C)2013 WATANABE Takuma <takumaw@sfo.kuramae.ne.jp>

Bookmarks Launcher for Google is a Chrome Extension for [Google Bookmarks](https://www.google.com/bookmarks/).

You can launch Google Bookmarks directly from your Google Chrome's application launcher.

Because [Google's Developer Program Policies](https://developers.google.com/chrome/web-store/program_policies) does not allow an "app where the primary functionality is to link to a website not owned by the developer",
this extension is released on Github.
